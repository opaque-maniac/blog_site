This is a simple blog website. It isn't complete but I don't think it will stay that way for long.
I did the basic backend work, it's simple because I just started working with django, hopefully I get better at it.

The app is in the config folder. All you need to run this is any version of python3 and django installed.

As I said, simple app for my learning.

To run app:
	1. Clone the repository, it's public.
	2. "cd" into the repository folder.
	4. "cd" into the config2 folder.
	5. Run the django-test server to see it.
		"python3 manage.py runserver"

I will host the website soon, just have to have some kinks worked out first before any of this blows up in my face once I have it live.
Have fun!

I just updated the way links for the project are refered to on the templates and in the app itself.
I added a app_name attribute to the url files for namespacing.
